# Terminal to Inbox

Terminal to Inbox is a command-line tool that collects information from multiple sources, including calendars, to-do lists, due dates, weather, and news, and delivers a daily digest directly to your email inbox.

Optionally, the tool can generate an AI-powered summary that highlights important events, deadlines, tasks, and priorities, allowing you to quickly understand your day without checking multiple applications.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd terminal-to-inbox
```

### Install Dependencies

Using uv (recommended):

```bash
uv sync
```

Or using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root. An example .env file is provided.

### Setting Up Notion

Terminal to Inbox reads tasks and due dates from Notion databases using the Notion API.

#### 1. Create a Notion Integration

1. Visit the Notion Integrations page:
   https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations
2. Click **New Integration**.
3. Give the integration a name (for example, *Terminal to Inbox*).
4. Select the workspace that contains your databases.
5. Create the integration and copy the **Internal Integration Secret**.

Add it to your `.env` file:

```env id="e4wbs4"
NOTION_API_KEY=ntn_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### 2. Share Your Database with the Integration

For each database you want to use:

1. Open the database page in Notion.
2. Click **•••** in the upper-right corner.
3. Select **Connections**.
4. Choose your integration.
5. Confirm access.

The integration must have access to the database before it can read any data.

#### 3. Find the Database ID

Open the database in your browser.

A database URL looks similar to:

```text id="jlwm7m"
https://www.notion.so/workspace/To-do-List-e62f0bed024b836295c101c4532e1bc3?v=1234567890abcdef
```

The database ID is the 32-character string near the end of the URL:

```text id="l70t2u"
e62f0bed024b836295c101c4532e1bc3
```

Add the IDs to your `.env` file:

```env id="cv57qs"
NOTION_TODO_DATABASE_ID=e62f0bed024b836295c101c4532e1bc3
NOTION_DUEDATE_DATABASE_ID=378f0bed024b806cb0cdcea902abf825
```

#### Example Databases

To-Do Database:

```text id="v3cvnz"
https://app.notion.com/p/To-do-List-ex-e62f0bed024b836295c101c4532e1bc3
```

Due Date Database:

```text id="gndgbm"
https://app.notion.com/p/378f0bed024b806cb0cdcea902abf825?v=ec9f0bed024b83db96fe88de353c39fd
```

To customize either database:

1. Open the page.
2. Click **•••** in the upper-right corner.
3. Select **Duplicate**.
4. Share the duplicated database with your integration.
5. Update the corresponding database ID in your `.env` file.


### Verify the Installation

Run:

```bash
python email_tool.py content
```

Expected output:

```text

```

You can then begin adding content sources and sending daily digests.

## Usage

### How It Works

1. Add the content sources you want included in your daily digest.
2. Review the configured content using the `content` command.
3. Send the digest to your inbox using the `send` command.

---

## Commands

### View Current Content

3. Due Date: Notion
4. News: general
5. Calendar: Google (your-email@gmail.com)
6. To Do: Notion
```

### Remove Content

```bash
python email_tool.py delete-content <number>
```

```bash
python email_tool.py delete-content 3
```

Removes the specified content section from the email configuration.

The content number corresponds to the order shown by the `content` command.

```

Or specify a location using coordinates:

```bash
python email_tool.py add-weather --lat 32.8595 --lon -117.2124 --name "San Diego, California"
```

Adds weather information including:

* Current temperature
* Daily highs and lows
* Sunrise and sunset times

### Add AI Summary

* Ollama (local models)

> **Note:** If the AI Summary is enabled, it will always appear at the top of the email, regardless of when it was added to the configured content list.


## Example Workflow

python email_tool.py add-calendar
python email_tool.py add-todo
python email_tool.py add-duedate
python email_tool.py add-weather
